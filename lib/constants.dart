final aboutMe = Text("""Hi, I'm Moizz Uddin Ahmad — a passionate Flutter Developer Intern and a final-year Software Engineering student. Though I’m just beginning my professional journey, I’ve already developed a strong foundation in cross-platform app development using Flutter and Dart.

I discovered my love for Flutter early in my academic journey, and it quickly became my favorite tool for building smooth, beautiful, and responsive mobile applications. One of my recent projects, a weather app, allowed me to apply what I’ve learned and reinforced my desire to grow further in this field.

My goal is to become a senior Flutter developer—not just technically strong, but someone who can lead, mentor, and inspire a team of aspiring developers. I'm continuously learning and exploring, driven by the excitement of bringing ideas to life through code.""", style: GoogleFonts.poppins(textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)));
